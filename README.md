# Apple Scripts which Make Daily Life Easier

## Creating Gist from Clipboard Selection

This Applescript takes the clipboard contents and creates a public gist on Github. It asks for a filename and pastes the corresponding gist URL for the newly created gist to the clipboard. Optionally, the gist URL is opened in a new browser window.

### Prerequisites
Please install `gist` via [Homebrew][http://brew.sh]:
```bash
brew install gist
gist --login
```

## Mount Media on Kevin

This Applescript mounts the SMB share "media" from the server "Kevin".

## New iTerm Window

This Applescript opens a new iTerm window handling wether iTerm is already running or not.
