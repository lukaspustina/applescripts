# Apple Script to make daily Life easier

## Applescript for Creating Gist from Clipboard Selection

This Applescript takes the clipboard contents and creates a public gist on Github. It asks for a filename and pastes the corresponding gist URL for the newly created gist to the clipboard. Optionally, the gist URL is opened in a new browser window.

### Prerequisites
Please install `gist` via [Homebrew][http://brew.sh]:
> brew install gist

> gist --login
